# Overview #
To install the MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In correctly, following three steps must be done:
  * [The MX ADK must be first installed as Eclipse Plug-In.](EclipseInstallation_ADK.md)
  * [Then the MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In could be installed from the MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In site ](EclipseInstallation_PlugIn.md) http://mxupdate.googlecode.com/svn/mxupdate-eclipse-site/tags/ .
  * [At least the MxUpdate settings must be defined and the properties from MX loaded.](EclipseInstallation_Connect.md)
The correct installation could be [checked](EclipseInstallation_Check.md) after Eclipse was restarted.
